**The LDPL IRC Bot Library** is a super easy to use IRC bot library for [LDPL](https://www.github.com/lartu/ldpl).
It lets you write LDPL programs that connect to IRC servers, join channels, send messages and react to received messages in the simplest
way possible. This library requires **LDPL 4.3** or greater.

## Usage

Include the library into your LDPL project by copying the folder *ldpl-irc-bot* to your project directory and then adding the line:

`include "ldpl-irc-bot/ldpl_irc_bot.ldpl"`

before the `data` and `procedure` sections of your source file. The library is
ready to be used.

## Example and documentation
The file `ldpl_irc_bot.ldpl` is an example of how to use this library. The library is also documented within that file.

## License
The LDPL IRC Bot Library is heavily based on [**SirLogsalot**](https://github.com/gkbrk/SirLogsalot)
by [Gokberk Yaltirakli](https://github.com/gkbrk). His code is released under the *MIT LICENSE*
and so is this library.
